// Big word alert

// Operator precedence:
// Which operator function gets called first
// Functions are called in order of precedence
// HIGHER precedence wins

// Big word alert

// Associativity:
// What order operator functions get called in: left to right or right to left
// When functions have the same precedence
// Higher precedence will be called
